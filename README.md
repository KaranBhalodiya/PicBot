An automation selfie camera in python which can detect face  and smile both in python
There is a speech recognization so when you say a sentence in which there is a word "selfie" 
so It will automatically turn on your camera and try to recogniz face and smile.
When it will detect face and smile at a time it will capture a picture and store in <<Timestamp>>selfie.png file.
For example :input: BY speaking "Take my selfie"
